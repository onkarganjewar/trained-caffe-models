This repository contains trained neural networks obtained using [Caffe](https://github.com/onkarganjewar/caffe). This repo solely exists because GitHub LFS is not allowed on the public forks, yet. [Source](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/1906#issuecomment-390085699)
>  Git LFS on github.com does not currently support pushing LFS objects to public forks. GitHub Enterprise does support this behavior.
